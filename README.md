# currency-classifier

### Currency classifier that classifies US Dollars and Indian Rupee bills with an accuracy of 90.625% using ResNet-34 architecture.

We are using the [fastai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) for the implementation and [this amazing repo](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) to get our data.
There is a lot of room for improvement since this was put together in half an hour.
